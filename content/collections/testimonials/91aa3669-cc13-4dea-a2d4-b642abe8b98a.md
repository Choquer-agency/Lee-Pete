testimonial_content: 'My husband and I bought our first home and we could not have been happier with the service provided Pete and his team. Pete was patient, informative, personable and a great negotiator, getting us an a great deal on an amazing townhouse. Not only did Pete spend weekends taking us on well organized home tours, but also assisted us with reviewing and understanding the depreciation reports, strata docs etc. prior to making our decision. The service did not end after our offer was accepted. Pete and his team supported us throughout the entire closing process, which can be daunting to new owners such as ourselves. We would recommend Lee + Pete Vancouver Real Estate Group to anyone.'
