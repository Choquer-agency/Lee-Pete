testimonial_content: 'The Lee + Pete team were amazing and did a fantastic job from the start of our hunt to the day we took possession. Lee Bryant was always able to answer a lot of detailed questions especially with additional parking/storage (which we secured), the market, long term growth and his outlook on the downtown condo market. His negotiation skills made us feel comfortable to the price we were willing to pay. He actually advised us to hold off for a few months while the owner came down to a reasonable price which we were able to secure. Thank you to the entire team for making our holidays a special one..'
