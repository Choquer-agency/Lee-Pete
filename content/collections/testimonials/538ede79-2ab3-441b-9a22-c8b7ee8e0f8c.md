testimonial_content: 'We recently sold our condo and purchased a house with Pete Shpak from Lee and Pete, both purchase and sale were seamless! Pete and his team ensured our condo was in tip top shape for all the marketing materials and open house. Our condo sold in one week for full ask! We then purchased a home that has exceeded our expectations! In looking for our new home, Pete guided us through open houses in different neighbourhoods we were interested in, which made us feel comfortable with our final choice. I would not hesitate to recommend Pete for both your sale and purchase.'
